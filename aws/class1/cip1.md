# EC2
>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud

vertically scaling an instance:  you can make instances bigger or smaller whenever you need to.

## different types of EC2 Instances  
Instance types offer varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity, and give you the flexibility to choose the appropriate mix of resources for your applications.

- general purpose  
provide a good balance of compute, memory and networking resources

- compute optimized  
are ideal for compute intensive tasks like gaming service, high performance computing, or HPC, and even scientific modeling. 

- memory optimized

- accelerated computing
are good for floating point number calculations, graphics processing, or data pattern matching, as they use hardware accelerators.

- storage optimized
high performance for locally stored data.

## multiple billing options
- on demand
pay for the duration that your instance runs for

- reserved instances  
workloads or ones with predictable usage

- spot instances
 if your workloads can tolerate being interrupted.
