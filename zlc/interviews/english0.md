Hi, everyone.  
Good morning,  
I'm XX from Hubei, currently living and working in Beijing.  
  
I graduated from  Wuhan University of Science and Technology in 2014. My major is named Urban and Rural Planning & Resource Management. It's a subject of Human Geography.
After graduating, I worked as an ArcGIS supporter for 3 years until 2017. It's about land planning in rural. My work is including make electric planning maps for a village and handling some geography data from AUTO CAD to ArcGIS maps.   Then, I have been bored with my work, I want to work in a technology company. Because it's an information age, I want to take an active part in some businesses with the Internet.   

So I kept studying Java development skills on an educational website for almost one year.  The courses included using Java skills to build a simple website, and realize some management systems for a library. It has helped me to take the first step in software development. 
Then in 2017, I have been recommended for a job by my friend at a small company in Beijing. So I take an interview and get the job. 
Are then  I have taken part in some projects like ETL, java web, and data warehouse.  I learn a lot about backend development skills mainly about Java tech stacks, like Spring, Mybatis, and some database knowledge.   
	
Over the past two years, I've worked for a company providing Cloud-native application and data platform services.  
The data platform is based on a Paas platform consisting of Data Storage Engine Management, Data Integration, Model Design, Data Dev, Data Visual, and so on.
I'm the owner of Data Integration. It's mainly about offline and online Data synchronization. In the beginning, we developed bases on  Apache Nifi， but the user complained it was difficult to use, they just want something as simple as possible. So in the next generation, we have a large-scale improvement to adjust the architect and introduced some granular tools like Alibaba Datax and Apache Debezium including the Kafka connector.
As a data platform developer, I also have to focus on system maintenance and troubleshooting.  We worked on Docker and Kubernetes to help to manage our services including web service, schedule service, and some nodes of Hadoop and Kafka.
Besides, I managed the version of the images about the software and worked on making a package of the system including other components like Redis, Mysql, and frontend code to make it easier to deploy in different environments.
  
I think I'm a fast learner, smart and hard worker as software developer. I'd be glad to take on a challenge with my work.

In my spare time, I like to watch videos and football games.  
  
I'm out of work now because the company has a job cut for reducing the cost of the product which has been kept invested for 2 years.  It is hard to find good work during the depression period considering the stability and long-term operation of the company. So I have to keep seeking jobs for several months.
  
That's all about me,  
thank you for allowing me to introduce myself.
