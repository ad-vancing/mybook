[he DistributedMapCache is a NiFi concept which is used to store information for later retrieval, either by the current processor by another processor. There are two components - the DistributedMapCacheServer which runs on one node if you are in a cluster, and the DistributedMapCacheClientService which runs on all nodes if in a cluster, and communicates with the server. Both of these are Controller Services, configured in NiFi through the controller section in the top right toolbar. Processors use the client service to store and retrieve data from the cache server. In this case, DetectDuplicate uses the cache to store information about what it has seen and determine if it is a duplicate.](https://community.cloudera.com/t5/Support-Questions/DistributedMapCacheClientService-NiFi-Wecrawler-xml-template/m-p/165226#M127593)
